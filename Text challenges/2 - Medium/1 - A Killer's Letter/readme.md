## Text

```
Know your enemy. I have heard this sentence many times. Luckily, I do not have a lot of enemies. Later in my life, they might be numerous.

With what I have done I would not be surprised. In their minds, I might appear like a terrorist. Nevertheless, I believe in my work. Success will prevail. That's for sure. Onto this life or the next. Nobody shall forget me.

Chaos might ensue. However, I seek peace, for the world and for me. Uniting humankind. Reaching this goal might cost me my life. Counselors, presidents or dictators, everyone will react to this. Hitler too might talk about it. I will have only one chance, and so will you. Look out, it will be huge. Lucky you, this text might prevent it.
