Hey Dad.

It has been a while since we last talk. I sent my last letter on 12/01 and I am writing this one on 12/06. You never answered anyway. I can't even tell if you care about what happens to me. I still remember the last automn we passed together. This date will be anchored in my memory, it was a friday, the 11/10. We went for a walk in the forest, facing the wind. The trees were beautiful. We did not talk much, and yet, we said so much. I told you I was writing this on 12 of June. Today is the anniversary of mom's death. I miss her so much.

I know you did not like my departure, but this war was bigger than me, you, or anyone else. I just had to. Since I enroled, 3 years ago (I still remember the exact day I went through your door for the last time, it was the 12 of July), I never stopped believing in the cause I engaged for.

I have been deployed for 2 years now. Fighting in France, since the 12 April 1940. Unlike a lot of my comrades, I could not flee at Dunkirk, so I stayed and fight. I should not have. I was captured on 11/03. I am currently a prisoner of war. Nothing to be proud of. I am treated well. You would not hear of me if I said the contrary anyway.

I am running out of ink and paper. I hope to see you soon.

I love you Dad.
